# HIST-1050-Final-Project-Cartographer
Using LibGDX Java game engine, I tried to recreate I small part of what it is like to be an exploring cartographer and the difficulties that go along with it

Note! A lot of the assests in this game are not mine. I used as much creative commons and right free assests as much as possible but this is here to say that I put these items together for educational purposes and that I am grateful for the use of these assests.
